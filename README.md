# EASYMONEY - KEY SYSTEM ðŸ”¥
## What does this program do?
### It's fake "wallet hunter". This program pretends to hunt down bitcoin wallet and you can pretend that you are rich or make some videos. :D This version never finds any bitcoin so it goes to infinite and also includes keysystem. Keys can be found at bottom of this description. Password to wallet is now longer so it looks more realistic.
